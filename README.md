# Bachelor_Project_PLC

- The project explains the automation of a press machine using a
programmable logic controller (PLC).
- The operation of the machine
includes fitting two bearing and a shaft within the housing.
- This operation should be accurate because of sensitive tolerance at the
bearing and housing.
- The pressure applied to each machine part and
its displacement within the housing is monitored using load cell and
transducers like LVDT and the whole assembly process is controlled
by the program logic.
- The machine can be operated in both automatic
and manual mode. Thus the automation of this process will improve
productivity, safety and assembly accuracy.
